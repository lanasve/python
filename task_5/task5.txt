Input: string consists of opening and closing parentheses - 
command line argument. 
For transmission line as a sequence set in double quotes.

The result: string "YES", if the input string contains 
the correct sequence parentheses; or line "NO", if the sequence 
is incorrect. Sequence of parentheses is correct when 
all brackets can be divided in pairs "opening" - "closing", 
whereby each pair of parentheses following the closing the opening.

The explanation for mathematicians:
"" - (Empty string) - parentheses sequence is correct (PSC)
"(PSC)" - as PSC
"PSCPSC" (two PSC recorded together) - is PSC
